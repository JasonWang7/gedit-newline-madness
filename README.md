# Newline Madness, a plugin for gedit #

Change newline type for the current document  
<https://github.com/jefferyto/gedit-newline-madness>  
v0.2.0

All bug reports / feature requests / miscellaneous comments are welcome
at <https://github.com/jefferyto/gedit-newline-madness/issues>.

## Usage ##

This adds a new submenu at Edit > Change Line Endings to change newline
type for the current document. Note that this currently cannot be
undone with Undo.

The current newline type is also shown in the statusbar.

## Requirements ##

v0.2.0 and higher requires at least gedit 3.2. (Untested with gedit 3.0; it *may* work :-) )

gedit 2 users should use [v0.1.0][] (requires at least gedit 2.29.5).

## Credits ##
