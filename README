Newline Madness, a plugin for gedit
Change newline type for the current document
v0.1.0

This adds a new submenu at Edit > Change Line Endings to change newline
type for the current document. Note that this currently cannot be
undone with Undo.

The current newline type is also shown in the statusbar.

Requires gedit 2.29.5 or above

I've only tested this in my own environment (gedit 2.30.2, GTK+ 2.20.0,
Ubuntu 10.04), so incompatibilities / bugs are very possible!

Please send bug reports to <jeffery.to@gmail.com>.
